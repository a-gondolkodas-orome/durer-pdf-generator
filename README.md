Local contest problems with the teamnames printed in the header.

## USAGE:

0) Copy PDF files which need to be compiled in `pdfsrc/`.
1) Download team data in `Tab-separated value (.tsv, current sheet)` format to a file e.g. (`local.tsv`)
  - There is a live version for XV, ask for link. (3 columns for teamname, category and place)
2) At the start of `do.py` file, fill out the fields.
  - `possible_categories`: map category (name as in the TSV) to the corresponding main TEX file
  - `*_header`: The TSV file's header name which contains teamname, category and place
3) Run `python do.py local.tsv`
  - This creates for all places (here `VPG`) files like `target/VPG/105.pdf`.
  - You might want to check out the generated PDFs for the weirder teamnames.
4) Run `./merger.sh`
  - This needs `poppler`, which contains the `pdfunite` binary.
  - This creates `target/VPG.pdf` from all files in `target/VPG/*.pdf`.
5) You might need to tweak PDF overwrite generation in `overwrite` for special teamnames.

For future reference.

## Preprocess

I preprocessed some PDFs: I've merged

- K + paper
- K+ + paper 
- (every category in correct multiplicity) -> reserve.pdf

## Post-process

This merges all PDFs from a single place.

There is a tool `merger.sh` which does this job (see Usage)
